I am a Test Automation Engineer with over 3.5 years of experience in web automation testing. I specialize in building robust automation frameworks using Selenium, TestNG, and BDD with Cucumber, along with integrating test pipelines in CI/CD using Jenkins.
My focus is on designing efficient, scalable, and reliable test automation solutions that help organizations reduce manual testing efforts and deliver high-quality software products faster.
